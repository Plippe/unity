# Runner, a minimal side-scroller
In this tutorial we'll create a very simple endless running game. You'll learn to:
  - generate a layered background
  - reuse objects
  - use simple physics
  - detect input to make the player jump
  - implement a power-up
  - write a small event manager
  - switch stuff on and off on demand
  - make a minimal GUI

You're assumed to know your way around Unity's editor and know the basics of creating C# scripts. If you've completed the Clock tutorial you're good to go. The Graphs tutorial is useful too, but not necessary.

Note that I will often omit chunks of code that have remained the same, only new code is shown. The context of the new code should be clear.
